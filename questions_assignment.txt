1. How to check if a struct is null in Solidity?
2. Regarding the documentation can we use soldoc plugin in VScode?
3. Can there be multiple KYC requests for same customer?
4. As per the assignment details, to get the bank details we need to return type of Bank. But return type as struct is giving error.
This type is only supported in the new experimental ABI encoder. Use "pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;" to enable the feature.

the Bank is a supposed to be a struct as per instructions and as shared in link
(https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/contracts.html) above we need to create a contract and then we can return that object. Please explain 

5. a - 10 to B (loan kind)
   a - 10 to C (loan kind)
   Double spending the same 10 rupee value in account. Bank keep tracks of transactions.
   How does double spending is avoided using nonce?
   cannot use the same starting balance. nonce in transaction is incremented everytime new transaction is sent.
   EVM is responsible for adding nonce. Validation will fail even if evm is hacked.
   Input is output from previous transaction. 

   payable if function can accepts ethers. for ex 
   buy tokens from app. 
   
   payable doesnot affect the gas cost

   blockchain for roaming transactions

   Data is very expensive on solidity.

   multiple contracts in one solidity file what will happen?
   Will all be deployed?
